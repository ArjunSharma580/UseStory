1. As an administrator:
● We want users to sign up and login to the website so that they are
authenticated users.
● We want to restrict book requests to only one active book request per user so
that one user request is fulfilled before they can make another request.
2. As a user:
● We want to request for a book of my choice by filling up a form so that I can
display information about me and why I want to read a particular book.
● We want to receive a notification if someone has sent me a book so that I
know that my request has been responded to.
● We want to confirm that I have received a book so that the donor knows that
their book has reached the user.
● I would like to thank the book donor so that they know the gratitude I feel for
them.
3. As a book donor:
● I want to look at all the active book requests by different people so that I can
read details on why someone wants to read that book.
● I want to filter the book requests using a book search field so that I can look at
requests for only books which I have.
● I want to look at the address of people making book requests so that I can
send the book to them by post.
● I want to have a choice to pay for and send the book through online services
like amazon so that I can send someone a book even if I don't have it.
● I want to send an update to a user that I have sent them the book so that the
user knows that their request has been fulfilled.
● I want to be notified if a user has received the book I sent so that I know that
the book has reached them
